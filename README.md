# MITRE-ATT&CK
Understanding ATT&amp;CK Matrix for Enterprise. The minimum unit of analysis for this matrix is the combinations of Platform & Tactic & Technique & Data Source. Considering this, the matrix has 1715 registers.

1. Pie Chart (Platform): This graphic shows us the distribution of the registers by Platform. If we consider all the registers: 46% belongs to Windows, 29% belongs to macOS, and 25% belongs to Linux.

2. Blue Bar Charts (Tactics): This graphic shows us the following information: Number of Tactics, (On Top of the vertical bar chart) Relative Percentage with respect to the Total of Tactics of the selected Platform (Vertical bar chart), and the number of Techniques for each Tactic (Horizontal bar chart).


Select a Platform (Green box): Selecting a platform is important because it's going to set the total number of tactics (100%), techniques o data sources to calculate the percentage of coverage (Vertical bar charts).
  - All     : 11 Tactcis / 219 Techniques / 48 Data Sources

  - macOS   : 11 Tactcis / 130 Techniques / 41 Data Sources
  - Linux   : 11 Tactics / 108 Techniques / 42 Data Sources
2. Select a variable or variables for analysis (Below the green box): You have three options to filter data and perform an analysis (Tactics,Techniques, and Data Sources).
